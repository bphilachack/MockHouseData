Hey buddy, help me create a simple java springboot microservice that implements the following APIs.
I want the app to use a inmemory database that is populated with fake mock data for the endpoints for testing.
The app allows you to query for home rebuilds events.

API endpoints:

- History of the House. Knowing that the house was built. This api enriches the rebuild_status api.
METHOD: GET 
PATH: /homes/${HOME_ID}/inventory
RESPONSE:
{
	homeId : String,
	location: String,
	insuranceCompanyName: String,
	family: String
}

- Give you information on a rebuild that has happened
METHOD: GET
PATH: /homes/${HOME_ID}/rebuild_status/
RESPONSE:
[ {
	isCritical: boolean,
	homeId : String,
	success: boolean,
	startTimestamp: String, // ISO-8601 format
	endTimestamp: String, // ISO-8601 format
}]

Ask me questions if you're unsure of anything.

Please rewrite this as feature requirements so that multiple developers can work on this independently, so the features can be built one at a time concurrently if possible.
