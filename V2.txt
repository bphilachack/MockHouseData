**Feature Requirement 1: Application Setup**

**Feature Description:**
Initialize a Java Spring Boot application and set up the required project structure.

**Steps:**
1. Create a new Spring Boot project using a build tool like Maven or Gradle.
2. Configure the project to use Spring Boot and set up the necessary dependencies.
3. Define the project structure, including packages for controllers, services, repositories, and models.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The Spring Boot application should be successfully initialized.
- The project structure should adhere to best practices for a Spring Boot application.

**Feature Requirement 2: Implement In-Memory Database with Mock Data**

**Feature Description:**
Create an in-memory database and populate it with mock data for testing purposes.

**Steps:**
1. Choose an in-memory database, such as H2, for storing mock data.
2. Configure the in-memory database connection in the application properties.
3. Create entity classes representing homes and rebuild events.
4. Implement a data loader or repository to populate the in-memory database with mock data.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The in-memory database should be accessible and configured within the application.
- Mock data should be successfully loaded into the database.
- Entity classes for homes and rebuild events should be defined.

**Feature Requirement 3: Implement API Endpoint for Retrieving Home Inventory**

**Feature Description:**
Create an API endpoint to retrieve home inventory information by home ID.

**Steps:**
1. Create a controller class with a method to handle the `/homes/{HOME_ID}/inventory` endpoint.
2. Implement a service layer to fetch home inventory data based on the provided `HOME_ID`.
3. Serialize the response into a JSON format.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The API endpoint should be accessible via a GET request.
- It should accept a valid `HOME_ID` parameter.
- The response should include `homeId`, `location`, `insuranceCompanyName`, and `family` fields in JSON format.

**Feature Requirement 4: Implement API Endpoint for Retrieving Rebuild Status**

**Feature Description:**
Create an API endpoint to retrieve rebuild status information by home ID.

**Steps:**
1. Create a controller class with a method to handle the `/homes/{HOME_ID}/rebuild_status` endpoint.
2. Implement a service layer to fetch rebuild status data based on the provided `HOME_ID`.
3. Serialize the response into a JSON format.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The API endpoint should be accessible via a GET request.
- It should accept a valid `HOME_ID` parameter.
- The response should include an array of rebuild status objects with specific fields in JSON format.

**Feature Requirement 5: Populate In-Memory Database with Mock Rebuild Data**

**Feature Description:**
Populate the in-memory database with mock rebuild data for testing the `/homes/{HOME_ID}/rebuild_status` API endpoint.

**Steps:**
1. Extend the existing data loader or repository to include mock rebuild data.
2. Ensure that the rebuild data is associated with specific homes using their unique `homeId`.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Mock rebuild data should be successfully inserted into the in-memory database.
- The rebuild data should cover various scenarios, including critical/non-critical events and successful/unsuccessful rebuilds.

**Feature Requirement 6: Enrich Home Inventory Data with Rebuild History**

**Feature Description:**
Enhance the `/homes/{HOME_ID}/inventory` API endpoint to include rebuild history information.

**Steps:**
1. Modify the controller method for `/homes/{HOME_ID}/inventory` to fetch both inventory and rebuild history data.
2. Retrieve the associated rebuild history for the home from the in-memory database.
3. Include the rebuild history information in the response JSON.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The `/homes/{HOME_ID}/inventory` endpoint should provide both inventory and rebuild history information in its response.
- The response should include fields for inventory as well as rebuild history.

By following these steps and feature requirements, the Java Spring Boot application can be developed to implement the specified APIs, set up an in-memory database with mock data, and provide the requested functionality for querying home inventory and rebuild status. Multiple developers can work on different features concurrently, ensuring efficient development and testing.
