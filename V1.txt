**Feature 1: Retrieve Home Inventory**

*Description*: Create an API endpoint that allows users to retrieve the history and details of a house, including its location, insurance company name, and family residing in it.

*API Endpoint*:
- Method: GET
- Path: `/homes/{HOME_ID}/inventory`

*Response*:
```json
{
    "homeId": "String",
    "location": "String",
    "insuranceCompanyName": "String",
    "family": "String"
}
```

*Steps for Setting Up the Java Spring Boot Application*:

1. **Project Initialization**:
   - Create a new Spring Boot project using Spring Initializer or your preferred IDE.
   - Add the necessary dependencies, including Spring Web and any database-related dependencies if required.

2. **Define Entity Class**:
   - Create an entity class (e.g., `Home`) to represent the home inventory data.
   - Include fields for `homeId`, `location`, `insuranceCompanyName`, and `family`.

3. **Create a Controller**:
   - Develop a controller class (e.g., `HomeController`) to handle the API request.
   - Implement a method to handle the GET request for `/homes/{HOME_ID}/inventory`.
   - Retrieve home inventory data based on the provided `HOME_ID` and return it as a JSON response.

4. **Data Mocking**:
   - For the initial setup, you can mock the data directly within the controller method.
   - Later, replace the data mocking with actual data retrieval logic, such as database queries.

**Feature 2: Retrieve Rebuild Status**

*Description*: Create an API endpoint that allows users to obtain information on rebuild events that have occurred for a specific home.

*API Endpoint*:
- Method: GET
- Path: `/homes/{HOME_ID}/rebuild_status/`

*Response*:
```json
[
    {
        "isCritical": true,
        "homeId": "String",
        "success": true,
        "startTimestamp": "String (ISO-8601 format)",
        "endTimestamp": "String (ISO-8601 format)"
    }
]
```

*Steps for Setting Up the Java Spring Boot Application*:

1. **Controller Modification**:
   - Extend the existing `HomeController` or create a new controller (e.g., `RebuildStatusController`) for this feature.
   - Implement a method to handle the GET request for `/homes/{HOME_ID}/rebuild_status/`.
   - Retrieve rebuild status data based on the provided `HOME_ID` and return it as a JSON response.

2. **Data Mocking**:
   - Initially, mock the rebuild status data within the controller method.
   - Later, replace the data mocking with actual data retrieval logic, considering appropriate data storage (e.g., database).

3. **Error Handling and Validation**:
   - Implement error handling and validation to handle cases such as invalid `HOME_ID` or data not found gracefully.

4. **Pagination (Optional)**:
   - If a large number of rebuild events are expected, consider adding pagination to the API response.

**Additional Notes**:
- Configure your Spring Boot application to connect to a database for storing and retrieving home and rebuild data.
- Use Spring Data JPA or other data access frameworks to interact with the database.
- Collaborate with stakeholders to refine API specifications as needed during development.
- Properly document the APIs, including request parameters and response structures.
- Implement security measures as necessary, such as authentication and authorization, depending on application requirements.
